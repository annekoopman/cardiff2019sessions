# This is the repo for cardiff 2019 speakers

There are a few reasons why we are getting this done before rather than afterwards

* access - if we know where the content is, we have a global backup on the day in case the worst happens
* accessibility - we have aspirations (still work in progress) to make this more accessible than last year, potentially with remote streaming/live captioning/pre-prepped audio descriptions
* legacy - we would also love a record of what went on, so we can show people all your great work

## Structure

Please do the following

1. fork the repo to your user
2. make a folder with your name and session like this: `dave_parr-my_talk_title`
3. put your content into the folder
4. open a pull request back in

## What if that doesn't work for me?

If the above useage causes problems let us know.

* do you understand how to fork and PR? If not we're happy to show you
* You have a highly complex code base that doesn't suit this application? Great, let us know what you need and we can work with you
* You have a highly unorthodox talk that involves [interpretative dance/ puppet show/ dramatic readings]? Very exicting, see above.
